# File System Module
This project is made in Linux using POSIX and implements the following as described in the .pdf file:
```
-Listing directory contents(Chapter 2.3);
-Identifying and parsing section files(Chapter 2.4);
-Working with sections(Chapter 2.5);
-Sections filtering(Chapter 2.6).
```

## Getting Started
You can find this project's description(Chapter 1) and requirements(Chapter 2) in the .pdf file attached to it. Also, you should take a quick look over the code written in the .c file.
```
In order to test this project you need to:
1) Download .rar file and extract it;
2) Open a new terminal in that directory and write: "gcc -Wall a1.c -o a1" (Chapter 2.1);
3) In order to test it write: "python tester.py" (Chapter 3.1);
4) If you want more details while testing, open tester.py and change verbose to true before step3.
```
When submitted, this project was tested with a similar python file. Below I attached a photo showing the result of those tests.
